brsttest - A unit testing framework for the BrightScript programming 
language used in development for the Roku Digital Video Player inspired
by xUnit style testing systems.  

* Writing a Test Fixture
Test fixtures must conform to the two following behaviors:
1) The sub/function name must begin with 'test'
2) The sub/function must take a single 'object' type argument

An example:
Sub testAddition(t as object)
    a = 1
    b = 2
    t.assertEqual(3, a + b)
End Sub

The 'test' prefix to the method name is required so that the testing
framework may be able to discover the test in order to execute it, 
and the 't' argument is the test case from which all assertions are 
performed.  If the prefix is missing the test will not be found and
there for not executed.  And iff the argument signature is not which
is expected, the test will fail as the incorrect number of arguments
will be passed.

* Using the TestCase
The test case object passed into test methods contains a number of
methods which can be used to assert expected state as it is expected
to exist after some operations.  These methods include:
assertTrue
assertFalse
assertEqual
assertNotEqual
assertInvalid
assertNotInvalid

In the case of assertEqual and assertNotEqual, there is currently a
limitation in the number of types that can be handled.  These include
integer, float, and string types.  Comparing integer and floats is
also acceptable.  More robust type handling, including built in
BrightScript components such as roList, roArray and roAssociativeArray,
is planned for a future release.

* Identifying Files with Tests
By default, brsttest assumes all files in the 'sources' directory 
whose names begin with 'test' will contain test fixtures and parses 
for named test cases.  As such any tests you wish to be executed 
should be in files that conform to this protocol.

* Running Tests
First, obtain a copy of brsttest.brs and place it in your 'sources'
directory.  Second, at which ever point you'd like to execute your
tests call the BrsTestMain() subroutine.  All test files following
the protocol described above will be parsed for test fixtures, and
all tests found will be executed with their results being printed
to the debug console.

* Limitations
Due to the nature of the BrightScript language some features found
in traditional xUnit style frameworks are not present.  As the 
BrightScript language evolves and expands some of these features
will hopefully be added.  An incomplete list of typical xUnit 
features which are not supported follows.

1) Detailed Error Reporting:  Due to the nature of error handling
within BrightScript, only a minimal amount of information about
a failing test can be reported.  Currently, in the case of a 
failed assertion, only a message about the failure (such as the
two values which are not equal) is displayed.  For test errors,
a short description of the error in question is displayed.  
Unfortunately, as there is no formal exception mechanism in  
BrightScript, information such as the line the error occured or
a stacktrace can not be displayed.

2) OOP Style Test Cases
It has been a decision in the implementation of brstest to not
support an object oriented approach to authoring test cases (
collections of related test fixtures).  An intial prototype
of brstest took this approach but was scrapped due to the 
overhead of having to write both the test fixture methods and
support a 'constructor' which attached all of the methods
to a created roAssociativeArray object.  If it is shown that
there is a significant demand for being able to write this
style of tests, this decision will be re-evaluated.

3) TestCase setUp/tearDown Methods
Due to the divergance of brstest from traditional xUnit 
frameworks in the area of class based TestCases, setUp and
tearDown methods are not currently supported.  If there is
a high demand for these features, this decision will also
be re-evaluated.
